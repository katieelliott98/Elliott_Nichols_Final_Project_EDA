## Summary

<In this project we set out to explore the relationship between hydropower generation and stream discharge.Hydroelectric power accounts for 52 percent of renewable electricity generation and 7 percent of total electricity generation in the US. These plants are a critical clean energy resource for grid operators and utilities due to their operational flexibility, low maintenance costs, and non-intermittent production. However, hydroelectric generation is susceptible to climate change, and changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, glacial melt, and the frequency of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts may have a direct negative effect on electricity production. Thus, the impact of climate change on the variability and availability of streamflow is critical for current hydroelectric generation and future operational forecast plans.>

<For our analysis, we looked at power generation data from the EIA and stream gage data from the USGS. For generation data we selected generation sites/dams so that half were from the western United States and half from the East. Stream gage data was selected upstream from dams and reservoirs to get an accurate representation of stream flow over time. Both power generation data and stream flow were analyzed for seasonality and monotonic trends using a seasonal mann kendall test. This was to help understand if generation was increasing or decreasing as a result of stream flow. Outside factors not included in the analysis could also contribute to increases or decreases in power generation.>
